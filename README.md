# Employee Data Management
Employee Data Management makes it easy for the employer to keep track of records. The main concept we cover in our system is manage employee detail, manage salary, employee profile, calendar, designation. Admin is a responsible for operate whole system. Admin has rights to Add new Employee, each employee has a unique username and password to login in to system. After logging in to system an employee can view his/her profile. The password for the employee is autogenerated the first time. The employee can change his password once he logs in. 
The admin is responsible for updating or deleting the details of the employee. As the admin holds all the powers, there isn’t much that the employee does. The employee is just allowed to change his password and view his profile. Employee can access the calendar and also can get in touch with the HR, as the contact details of the same is provide in the console.
